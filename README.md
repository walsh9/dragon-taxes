## Description

A game where you are a dragon and you need to finish your tax return quickly. Pen and paper and calculator recommended.

## Mini FAQ

**Why are there no deductions?**

Dragons rarely actually spend their hoards, so they have no expenses to deduct.

**Why does a dragon have a smartphone?**

It's 2015.

**Is doing real taxes this hard?**

Well, the simplest United States income tax form, the 1040EZ, is two pages long and has 43 pages of instructions. But on the other hand, most people have longer than 10 minutes to work on it.
